# Mayonnaise
Forget shop-bought and make your own homemade mayonnaise. It takes a little effort but it's well worth it to accompany your favourite dishes. Read more at the [bbcgoodfood](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/basic-mayonnaise). 


## Ingredients
* 2 egg yolks
* 1 tbsp Dijon mustard
* 250ml sunflower oil
* 2 tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice

## Instructions
* Tip the egg yolks and mustard into a bowl, season with salt and pepper and whisk together until completely combined. 
* Whisking constantly, add a small drop of oil and whisk until completely combined, then add another drop and continue a drop at a time until the yolks and oil combine and start to thicken. 
* Once youâ€™re confident the oil and eggs are coming together you can add the oil a bit more at a time, but be patient, as adding the oil too quickly will cause the mayonnaise to split and curdle.
